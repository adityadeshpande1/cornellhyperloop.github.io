# Cornell Hyperloop FAQ

## Braking

Q: What is our goal?
> Our goal is to design a system that brings a 250mph moving pod to a stop. We'll do this by using both frictional and magnetic brakes, as well as an air-tank pneumatic system to supply the force we need. We'll be working closely with suspension and the electrical team to implement our design.

Q: What's the expected workload?
> Every member has deliverables each week, but most assigned work will be based on pressing issues at the moment. You'll be responsible for certain parts of the design, such as the magnetic or pneumatic system, and can progress at your own pace.

Q: What do you need to know beforehand?
> Nothing! All thatâ€™s expected is that you're passionate about science, engineering and designing. We work with and train new members in computer programs like CAD and ANSYS.



## Hardware

Q: How much do hardware and software collaborate?
> There is a lot of collaboration between hardware and software.The main overlap is within the sensor project. Hardware works on wiring the sensors to Arduinos, and then software helps us connect them to the Odroid (master computer).

Q: Since there are a lot of files in the Google Drive, which ones should I look at?
> In the main hardware folder, the Hardware Directory document links to important documents for each project.

Q: What happens during a typical week?
> We have a subteam meeting that usually lasts 30-45 minutes depending on how much we need to discuss. Members work on their assigned deliverables independently or with other members working on the same project. The amount of work depends on the number of credits you are enrolled in (~3 hours per credit).
