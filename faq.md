# Cornell Hyperloop FAQ

## Braking

Q: What is our goal?
> Our goal is to design a system that brings a 250mph moving pod to a stop. We'll do this by using both frictional and magnetic brakes, as well as an air-tank pneumatic system to supply the force we need. We'll be working closely with suspension and the electrical team to implement our design.

Q: What's the expected workload?
> Every member has deliverables each week, but most assigned work will be based on pressing issues at the moment. You'll be responsible for certain parts of the design, such as the magnetic or pneumatic system, and can progress at your own pace.

Q: What do you need to know beforehand?
> Nothing! All thatâ€™s expected is that you're passionate about science, engineering and designing. We work with and train new members in computer programs like CAD and ANSYS.


# Business Developemnt

Q: What is Business Development?
> According to Google, Business Development is the activity of pursuing strategic opportunities for a particular business or organization, but here at Cornell Hyperloop the Business Development Team, or the BizDev team as we call ourselves, operates as the node between all of the other subteams. We help fulfill the greater goal of creating a working pod and compete in the SpaceX Hyperloop Competition. To reach this goal the Bizdev team conducts outreach to companies for potential sponsorship opportunities, completes technical tasks, such as managing the Bill of Materials (BOM) to track spending through the semesters for each subteam, and market the team as a whole through social media posts and Cornell Hyperloop swag. 

Q: What major do you have to be to join BizDev?
> ANY! You do not have to be a business major or have deep background in the business field. Here on the Bizdev team we have Pre-med students, life sciences, technical engineers, and of course the business major or two. We as a team make sure every new member receives the proper training in all technical and non-technical skills required to complete the jobs as a Cornell Hyperloop BizDev member.

Q: Why join BizDev?
> BizDev allows technical and non-technical majors to form a bridge between both fields of studies. The BizDev team allows members to work closely with any other subteam of their choosing to better gain knowledge and skills that the member would like to have before graduating Cornell. 

Q: Are you a company looking to sponsor Cornell Hyperloop to help us reach our goal of winning the SpaceX competition?
> If you answered yes to that question, please send us a message and one of our bizdev members will contact you on all the possible ways you could help support our team (p.s. your company could be eligible for marketing opportunities via our program).


## Hardware

Q: How much do hardware and software collaborate?
> There is a lot of collaboration between hardware and software.The main overlap is within the sensor project. Hardware works on wiring the sensors to Arduinos, and then software helps us connect them to the Odroid (master computer).

Q: Since there are a lot of files in the Google Drive, which ones should I look at?
> In the main hardware folder, the Hardware Directory document links to important documents for each project.

Q: What happens during a typical week?
> We have a subteam meeting that usually lasts 30-45 minutes depending on how much we need to discuss. Members work on their assigned deliverables independently or with other members working on the same project. The amount of work depends on the number of credits you are enrolled in (~3 hours per credit).
